I've included two new features: file sharing feature and search and file filtering. The creation of these two features is an improvement over the earlier information. I used reactivity state and then developed filtering on the data array for search and file filtering. Regarding the File Sharing Feature, I changed the data such that the file links were produced at random.

## I. Search and File Filtering:

A file management programme must provide search and file filtering capabilities. These characteristics are crucial for the following reasons:

- Efficient Search:
  The key to finding the desired files quickly in a file management application with thousands or even millions of files is search. Users may quickly find files using a powerful search feature based on file names, types, modification dates, and other criteria. By doing this, you can avoid wasting time and energy on manual file searches.
- Improved Organization:
  Users can organise and categorise files using file filtering based on predetermined criteria. Users can establish file categories with this functionality, organise files by kind or attribute, and quickly access pertinent files. It permits easy navigation via their file groupings and improves organisation.
- Streamlined Workflow:
  In addition to increasing productivity, search and file filtering free up users to concentrate on their primary activities. Users may simply access the files they need for their work without being distracted by unneeded distractions thanks to the ability to swiftly search for files and filter search results. This boosts output and reduces confusion when looking for the appropriate files.

## II. File Sharing Feature:

The record sharing highlight could be a vital component in modern file administration applications. Here are a couple of reasons why this include is critical:

- Efficient Team Collaboration:
  In a collaborative work environment, simple and fast record sharing is basic. The record sharing highlight empowers clients to send records to colleagues, accomplices, or clients without depending on partitioned communication strategies. Group collaboration gets to be smoother with the capacity to share records that can be gotten to and overseen together.

- Scalability and Flexibility:
  In an period where remote work is progressively common, the record sharing include is exceedingly important. Clients can effortlessly share records with people found.
